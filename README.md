## Rules ##
<p>The specific rules for this project are:</p>
1. It must be art of some form (sculpture, painting, poetry, music, etc.) and not some sort of low-effort modern art. (High effort modern art may be acceptable)
2. Use a relay. This must drive a motor or some other high power load (a lamp, fan, etc.)
3. Destroy and use a power cable to hook up your relay to a power source. (This can be an AC power cable or the end of a DC adapter, like cutting off the end of a USB charger.) Make sure you attach AC loads to AC power sources, and DC loads to DC power sources. Also use proper safety precautions - don't strip cable while it's plugged in, and don't handle the relay while it's plugged in. Use electrician's gloves if you need to do so
4. You must solder something together. They must be able to stand up to a yank test. Use heat shrink tubing to cover soldered joints so you don't have exposed electrical conducting material in your project. I have tubing, a heat gun, and soldering irons for your use
5. It must interact somehow with the people walking past. This can be done in a variety of ways, from sensing motion or heat, to asking them to push a button, to using a camera to capture their souls. Your art must respond to them somehow

# Project Proposal #
Create a painting with hidden paint integrated into it that can only become visible with black lights.  The black lights will be connected to a relay, which gets activated with a photoresistor and an optional motion sensor light switch (for sustained viewing).
